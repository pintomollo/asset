function [new_img] = imcosmics(img, block_size, thresh)
% IMCOSMICS implements the cosmic rays removal from [1]. This algorithm works
% by removing pixels which values are separated from lower values by a gap larger
% than a threshold estimated using the median and the mad.
%
%   IMG = IMCOSMICS(RAYS, BLOCK_SIZE, THRESH) removes the cosmic rays in RAYS and
%   returns the cleaned IMG. The algorithm works by processing contiguous tiles of
%   size [BLOCK_SIZE BLOCK_SIZE] with an additional overlap of 0.5*BLOCK_SIZE in both
%   dimensions. Cosmic ray pixels are identified in each tile as the pixels which
%   value are separated from lower values by a gap larger than THRESH*MAD. These
%   pixels are then replaced by the median value in the corresponding tile. This
%   process is repeated iteratively until convergeance of the detection (up to 5 times).
%
%   IMG = IMCOSMICS(RAYS, BLOCK_SIZE) utilizes the published THRESH value of 3.
%
%   IMG = IMCOSMICS(RAYS) utilizes in addition the published BLOCK_SIZE value of 10.
%
%   IMGS = IMCOSMICS(STACK, ...) processes each plane of the stack independently.
