function mymovie = track_centrosomes3D(mymovie, opts) %work in progress
% TRACK_CENTROSOMES detects and tracks over time the position of the two centrosomes
% in a fluorescence time-lapse recording. This algorithm is designed to find two and
% only two "particles".
%
%   MYMOVIE = TRACK_CENTROSOMES(MYMOVIE, OPTS) detects particles in the "data"
%   channel of MYMOVIE, identifies the centrosomes and tracks them over time. These
%   results are stored in the "centrosomes" field of "data".
%
%   [...] = TRACK_CENTROSOMES(MYMOVIE) uses the default value of OPTS as provided by
%   get_struct('ASSET').
