function mymovie = identify_channels(channels, opts)
% IDENTIFY_CHANNELS identifies the type of data contained in each channel of the movie,
% including the type of filtering required and prompts the user for verification. In
% addition, this function incorporates the different channels into the "mymovie"
% structure (see get_struct.m).
%
%   [MYMOVIE] = IDENTIFY_CHANNEL(CHANNELS, OPTS) converts the channels, initially an
%   array of "channel" structures (see get_struct.m), into the mymovie structure, while
%   inferring the type of data in each of them.
